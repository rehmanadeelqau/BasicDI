# DRI BasicDI Kata

The aim of this exercise is to produce a very simple Dependency Injection container which meets the criteria defined by the Unit Tests. 
It is not intended for use in production, and thus its capabilities are minimal.

This kata will require an understanding of several concepts in order to complete it:
 - Dependency Injection
 - Reflection
 - Generics

## DRI.BasicDI.UnitTests

Start with this project. You may implement the unit tests in any order that you see fit, although it is recommended that you start with the `RegistrationTests` first.
Example classes are provided in the `TestClasses` folder. These should be enough to meet the criteria of the unit tests.

If you think of additional unit tests feel free to add them. The initial tests are intended as a guide.

## DRI.BasicDI

Add your implementation to this project. The `Container` class has been created with the expected public interface. You may modify this if you wish, but you must justify your reasons.
The `Exceptions` folder contains the expected exception types, but again you may add or modify these if you see fit.

## Time to complete.

This kata should take anywhere between 2 - 4 hours.
